"motivation_events.gif","Frederick Herzberg points out that satisfaction at work is not the opposite of dissatisfaction.   The graphic below is from:

Frederick Herzberg ""One More Time: How Do You Motivate Employees?"" Harvard Business Review, September-October 1987, pp. 109-120

Herzberg asked some employees to describe events in their job that either a) caused ""extreme dissatisfaction"" or b) cause ""extreme satisfaction"".  He then categorized the event in terms of the categories on the graphic below.  The top part of the graphic relates to events in categories he described as ""intrinsic motivators"".  The bottom part of the graphic relates to events in categories he thought of as ""hygiene factors"".  Dissatisfaction events extend the bar to the left from the center, in light gray, satisfaction events extend the bar to the right from the center, in dark gray.    For example, the top horizontal bar in the graphic relates to events that Herzberg categorized as ""achievement"".  About 10 percent of all events were ""extreme dissatisfaction"" and in the achievement category (failure). 40 percent were ""extreme satisfaction"" / achievement.  (The percentages don't add up to 100 across the graphic because events can be in more than one category).

The arrangement of the graphic emphasizes that the events that make people dissatisfied are in different categories from the events that make people satisfied.  Herzberg argues that you can't increase motivation much by concentrating on removing dissatisfaction, you have to increase satisfaction, and that there will be a large difference between these two approaches.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pkH1PK-Ua4Y/U3ZfO7dqbLI/AAAAAAAAAVY/MbIwc-bhEW4SLcwWG1YT5iVTAtIrVDWtwCLABGAYYCw/s0-d/motivation_events.gif","","909","May 16, 2014, 6:55:55 PM UTC","Feb 6, 2019, 5:25:15 PM UTC","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0"
